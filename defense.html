            <h2>Stopper</h2>
            <P class="list">
                The <i>"Stopper"</i> is the top of the defense diamond. They are a more offensive defense member. Their role is to go up and help the offense keep the ball in the opponents side and give the midfields a person to fall back on if they need to. That being said, the stopper has to do a lot of running to get back on defense when the ball comes back into your side.

            <h2>Left / Right Wing</h2>
            <p class="list">
                <i>"Left wing and Right wing"</i> essentially have the same role. They are the left and right of the diamond. They just occupy different sides of the field. They are backup to the stopper for if the oppoents get passed them and are coming down their side of the field. Both of these positions will do majority of the throw-ins when necassary.

            <h2>Sweeper</h2>
            <p class="list">
                The <i>"Sweeper"</i> is the bottom of the diamond. The second to last line of defense. The sweeper's job is to watch everyone, teammates and opponents alike. They are to stop anyone that gets past the left and right wing. The sweeper can also call out to one of those sides to switch with them so they temporarily switch positions if the sweeper believes they can handle the one person coming so the teammate can get back and back them up if they end up failing. The sweeper will do the goal kicks as well.

            <h2>Goalie</h2>
            <p class="list">
                The last line of defense is the <i>"Goalie"</i>, one of the most important in the game. They control the defense by also observing like the sweeper does. The goalie can call out for their teammates to make a player who is all alone. They have to trust the defense as the defense has to trust them back. The goalie has to stop the ball no matter what and the whole goal of the defensive side is to get it out of their territory.
