                    The <i>"CenterForward Midfield"</i> is an honorary striker. They will help push up and try to score. Unlike the strikers they will need to get back if the ball is overturned to the other team, so that they can get back to defend. All the midfielders do a considerable amount of running up and down the field as they play.

                <h2>Left / Right Midfield</h2>
                <p class="list">
                    <i>"Left wing and Right wing"</i> essentially have the same role. They are the left and right of the midfield diamond. They just occupy different sides of the field. They will run up the sides of the field with the strikers and centerforward to give them a passing opportunity and if they had the ball they would cross it to the center to try to have a teammate score. If their team was to lose posession they would need to get back and help on defense.

                <h2>CenterBack Midfield</h2>
                <p class="list">
                    The <i>"CenterBack Midefield"</i> is especially seen as part of the defense if posession is lost. They would need to hurry back and help out, but they also will help out the offense by giving the chance for a teammate to pass back to them to keep it in play if need be. 
                </p>

            <li>
               <h2> Striker</h2>
                <p class="list">
                    <i>"Strikers"</i> are the two most forward players on a team. They are the main attackers on the offense. They do not always have to go back when the posession is lost because they would need to stay near midfield to counterattack when the ball was regained by their team. They will normally do corner kicks or have a midfielder do it so they could receive the kick in the box to try and score.
