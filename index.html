        Soccer conists of 22 people on one field. 11 people on one team. The formations of the players can vary, but the main formation is 1 goalie, 4 defense, 4 midfield, and 2 strikers. The midfield and defense are in a diamond shape. In the diamond shape the teammates can rely on the other players in the diamond to pass to or to get open for someone to pass to. Soccer is very much a team sport that needs all 11 players to be contributing in order to win the game.
